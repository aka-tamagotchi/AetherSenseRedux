# AetherSense Redux

[![volkswagen status](https://auchenberg.github.io/volkswagen/volkswargen_ci.svg?v=1)](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen)

Turn your Warrior of Light into the Warrior of Butt with regex-powered realtime log parsing. Configure custom vibration patterns for game controllers, bluetooth-enabled sex toys, and more!

Inspired by [AetherSense](https://github.com/Ms-Tress/AetherSense), powered by [Buttplug](https://buttplug.io/), controlled by you.

### Installation

#### Preferred Method
 
Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aka-tamagotchi/EgirlPlugins/main/repo.json` to your custom repo list and then install through Dalamud.

#### Manual Method

Unzip into %appdata%\XIVLauncher\devPlugins\ and restart the game.

Requires Intiface Desktop, XIVLauncher, and Dalamud to operate.

### Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions

### Development

#### Environment Config

- XIVLauncher must be installed and present.
  - If a custom path is required for Dalamud's dev directory, it must be set with the `DALAMUD_HOME` environment variable. The correct path will be to Dalamud's `Hooks/dev` directory. Examples of this are:
    - Windows: `$APPDATA\XIVLauncher\addon\Hooks\dev\`
    - Linux: `$HOME/.xlcore/dalamud/Hooks/dev`

### Support

This project is a labor of love, and I don't earn any money for developing it. But if you've gotten something out of it and want to give back, please, buy me a coffee!

### Credits

- Uses [XIVChatTools](https://github.com/digital-pet/XIVChatTools) for extended filtering capabilities.
- Inspired by the original [AetherSense](https://github.com/Ms-Tress/AetherSense) plugin by Ms Tress.
